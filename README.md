# Employee-Data-Analysis
Utilization of SQL to explore employee data
This repository started out with numerous different csv's that contained past employee data from a company. The csv's were then imported into different tables in a SQL database. Following this, an ERD was constructed in order to visualize and make sense of how the different tables relate to one another. Following this, various queries were run to answer questions about the data. These queries include ...

(Below each query is an example image of what the query would look like if it were to be performed with sql)

1)List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
